\fBdig\fP [global\-queryopt...] [query...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdig\fP is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It
performs DNS lookups and displays the answers that are returned from the
name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use \fBdig\fP to
troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use and
clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality
than \fBdig\fP\&.
.sp
Although \fBdig\fP is normally used with command\-line arguments, it also
has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A
brief summary of its command\-line arguments and options is printed when
the \fB\-h\fP option is given. Unlike earlier versions, the BIND 9
implementation of \fBdig\fP allows multiple lookups to be issued from the
command line.
.sp
Unless it is told to query a specific name server, \fBdig\fP will try each
of the servers listed in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP\&. If no usable server
addresses are found, \fBdig\fP will send the query to the local host.
.sp
When no command line arguments or options are given, \fBdig\fP will
perform an NS query for "." (the root).
.sp
It is possible to set per\-user defaults for \fBdig\fP via
\fB${HOME}/.digrc\fP\&. This file is read and any options in it are applied
before the command line arguments. The \fB\-r\fP option disables this
feature, for scripts that need predictable behaviour.
.sp
The IN and CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top level domain
names. Either use the \fB\-t\fP and \fB\-c\fP options to specify the type and
class, use the \fB\-q\fP the specify the domain name, or use "IN." and
"CH." when looking up these top level domains.
.SH SIMPLE USAGE
.sp
A typical invocation of \fBdig\fP looks like:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dig @server name type
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
where:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBserver\fP
is the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an
IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in
colon\-delimited notation. When the supplied \fBserver\fP argument is a
hostname, \fBdig\fP resolves that name before querying that name
server.
.sp
If no \fBserver\fP argument is provided, \fBdig\fP consults
\fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP; if an address is found there, it queries the
name server at that address. If either of the \fB\-4\fP or \fB\-6\fP
options are in use, then only addresses for the corresponding
transport will be tried. If no usable addresses are found, \fBdig\fP
will send the query to the local host. The reply from the name server
that responds is displayed.
.TP
.B \fBname\fP
is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up.
.TP
.B \fBtype\fP
indicates what type of query is required MDASH ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.
\fBtype\fP can be any valid query type. If no \fBtype\fP argument is
supplied, \fBdig\fP will perform a lookup for an A record.
.UNINDENT
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-4\fP
Use IPv4 only.
.TP
\fB\-6\fP
Use IPv6 only.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP address[#port]
Set the source IP address of the query. The \fBaddress\fP must be a
valid address on one of the host\(aqs network interfaces, or "0.0.0.0"
or "::". An optional port may be specified by appending "#<port>"
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Set the query class. The default \fBclass\fP is IN; other classes are
HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP file
Batch mode: \fBdig\fP reads a list of lookup requests to process from
the given \fBfile\fP\&. Each line in the file should be organized in the
same way they would be presented as queries to \fBdig\fP using the
command\-line interface.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP keyfile
Sign queries using TSIG using a key read from the given file. Key
files can be generated using tsig\-keygen8. When using TSIG
authentication with \fBdig\fP, the name server that is queried needs to
know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done
by providing appropriate \fBkey\fP and \fBserver\fP statements in
\fBnamed.conf\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-m\fP
Enable memory usage debugging.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP port
Send the query to a non\-standard port on the server, instead of the
default port 53. This option would be used to test a name server that
has been configured to listen for queries on a non\-standard port
number.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP name
The domain name to query. This is useful to distinguish the \fBname\fP
from other arguments.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
Do not read options from \fB${HOME}/.digrc\fP\&. This is useful for
scripts that need predictable behaviour.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP type
The resource record type to query. It can be any valid query type. If
it is a resource record type supported in BIND 9, it can be given by
the type mnemonic (such as "NS" or "AAAA"). The default query type is
"A", unless the \fB\-x\fP option is supplied to indicate a reverse
lookup. A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of
AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, set the
\fBtype\fP to \fBixfr=N\fP\&. The incremental zone transfer will contain
the changes made to the zone since the serial number in the zone\(aqs
SOA record was \fBN\fP\&.
.sp
All resource record types can be expressed as "TYPEnn", where "nn" is
the number of the type. If the resource record type is not supported
in BIND 9, the result will be displayed as described in \fI\%RFC 3597\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP
Print query times in microseconds instead of milliseconds.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP addr
Simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names. The
\fBaddr\fP is an IPv4 address in dotted\-decimal notation, or a
colon\-delimited IPv6 address. When the \fB\-x\fP is used, there is no
need to provide the \fBname\fP, \fBclass\fP and \fBtype\fP arguments.
\fBdig\fP automatically performs a lookup for a name like
\fB94.2.0.192.in\-addr.arpa\fP and sets the query type and class to PTR
and IN respectively. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format
under the IP6.ARPA domain.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP [hmac:]keyname:secret
Sign queries using TSIG with the given authentication key.
\fBkeyname\fP is the name of the key, and \fBsecret\fP is the base64
encoded shared secret. \fBhmac\fP is the name of the key algorithm;
valid choices are \fBhmac\-md5\fP, \fBhmac\-sha1\fP, \fBhmac\-sha224\fP,
\fBhmac\-sha256\fP, \fBhmac\-sha384\fP, or \fBhmac\-sha512\fP\&. If \fBhmac\fP is
not specified, the default is \fBhmac\-md5\fP or if MD5 was disabled
\fBhmac\-sha256\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBNOTE:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
You should use the \fB\-k\fP option and avoid the \fB\-y\fP option,
because with \fB\-y\fP the shared secret is supplied as a command line
argument in clear text. This may be visible in the output from ps1 or
in a history file maintained by the user\(aqs shell.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH QUERY OPTIONS
.sp
\fBdig\fP provides a number of query options which affect the way in which
lookups are made and the results displayed. Some of these set or reset
flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the
answer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry
strategies.
.sp
Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign
(\fB+\fP). Some keywords set or reset an option. These may be preceded by
the string \fBno\fP to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords
assign values to options like the timeout interval. They have the form
\fB+keyword=value\fP\&. Keywords may be abbreviated, provided the
abbreviation is unambiguous; for example, \fB+cd\fP is equivalent to
\fB+cdflag\fP\&. The query options are:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB+[no]aaflag\fP
A synonym for \fB+[no]aaonly\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]aaonly\fP
Sets the "aa" flag in the query.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]additional\fP
Display [do not display] the additional section of a reply. The
default is to display it.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]adflag\fP
Set [do not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query. This
requests the server to return whether all of the answer and authority
sections have all been validated as secure according to the security
policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records have been
validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT\-OUT range. AD=0
indicate that some part of the answer was insecure or not validated.
This bit is set by default.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]all\fP
Set or clear all display flags.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]answer\fP
Display [do not display] the answer section of a reply. The default
is to display it.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]authority\fP
Display [do not display] the authority section of a reply. The
default is to display it.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]badcookie\fP
Retry lookup with the new server cookie if a BADCOOKIE response is
received.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]besteffort\fP
Attempt to display the contents of messages which are malformed. The
default is to not display malformed answers.
.TP
.B \fB+bufsize=B\fP
Set the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to \fBB\fP
bytes. The maximum and minimum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0
respectively. Values outside this range are rounded up or down
appropriately. Values other than zero will cause a EDNS query to be
sent.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]cdflag\fP
Set [do not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This
requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]class\fP
Display [do not display] the CLASS when printing the record.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]cmd\fP
Toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output, identifying the
version of \fBdig\fP and the query options that have been applied.  This option
always has global effect; it cannot be set globally and then overridden on a
per\-lookup basis.  The default is to print this comment.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]comments\fP
Toggles the display of some comment lines in the output, containing
information about the packet header and OPT pseudosection, and the names of
the response section.  The default is to print these comments.
.sp
Other types of comments in the output are not affected by this option, but
can be controlled using other command line switches. These include
\fB+[no]cmd\fP, \fB+[no]question\fP, \fB+[no]stats\fP, and \fB+[no]rrcomments\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]cookie=####\fP
Send a COOKIE EDNS option, with optional value. Replaying a COOKIE
from a previous response will allow the server to identify a previous
client. The default is \fB+cookie\fP\&.
.sp
\fB+cookie\fP is also set when +trace is set to better emulate the
default queries from a nameserver.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]crypto\fP
Toggle the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC records. The
contents of these field are unnecessary to debug most DNSSEC
validation failures and removing them makes it easier to see the
common failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted
they are replaced by the string "[omitted]" or in the DNSKEY case the
key id is displayed as the replacement, e.g. "[ key id = value ]".
.TP
.B \fB+[no]defname\fP
Deprecated, treated as a synonym for \fB+[no]search\fP
.TP
.B \fB+[no]dnssec\fP
Requests DNSSEC records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK bit (DO) in
the OPT record in the additional section of the query.
.TP
.B \fB+domain=somename\fP
Set the search list to contain the single domain \fBsomename\fP, as if
specified in a \fBdomain\fP directive in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP, and
enable search list processing as if the \fB+search\fP option were
given.
.TP
.B \fB+dscp=value\fP
Set the DSCP code point to be used when sending the query. Valid DSCP
code points are in the range [0..63]. By default no code point is
explicitly set.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]edns[=#]\fP
Specify the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255.
Setting the EDNS version will cause a EDNS query to be sent.
\fB+noedns\fP clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is set to 0 by
default.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ednsflags[=#]\fP
Set the must\-be\-zero EDNS flags bits (Z bits) to the specified value.
Decimal, hex and octal encodings are accepted. Setting a named flag
(e.g. DO) will silently be ignored. By default, no Z bits are set.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ednsnegotiation\fP
Enable / disable EDNS version negotiation. By default EDNS version
negotiation is enabled.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ednsopt[=code[:value]]\fP
Specify EDNS option with code point \fBcode\fP and optionally payload
of \fBvalue\fP as a hexadecimal string. \fBcode\fP can be either an EDNS
option name (for example, \fBNSID\fP or \fBECS\fP), or an arbitrary
numeric value. \fB+noednsopt\fP clears the EDNS options to be sent.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]expire\fP
Send an EDNS Expire option.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]fail\fP
Do not try the next server if you receive a SERVFAIL. The default is
to not try the next server which is the reverse of normal stub
resolver behavior.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]header\-only\fP
Send a query with a DNS header without a question section. The
default is to add a question section. The query type and query name
are ignored when this is set.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]identify\fP
Show [or do not show] the IP address and port number that supplied
the answer when the \fB+short\fP option is enabled. If short form
answers are requested, the default is not to show the source address
and port number of the server that provided the answer.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]idnin\fP
Process [do not process] IDN domain names on input. This requires IDN
SUPPORT to have been enabled at compile time.
.sp
The default is to process IDN input when standard output is a tty.
The IDN processing on input is disabled when dig output is redirected
to files, pipes, and other non\-tty file descriptors.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]idnout\fP
Convert [do not convert] puny code on output. This requires IDN
SUPPORT to have been enabled at compile time.
.sp
The default is to process puny code on output when standard output is
a tty. The puny code processing on output is disabled when dig output
is redirected to files, pipes, and other non\-tty file descriptors.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ignore\fP
Ignore truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP. By
default, TCP retries are performed.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]keepalive\fP
Send [or do not send] an EDNS Keepalive option.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]keepopen\fP
Keep the TCP socket open between queries and reuse it rather than
creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is
\fB+nokeepopen\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]mapped\fP
Allow mapped IPv4 over IPv6 addresses to be used. The default is
\fB+mapped\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]multiline\fP
Print records like the SOA records in a verbose multi\-line format
with human\-readable comments. The default is to print each record on
a single line, to facilitate machine parsing of the \fBdig\fP output.
.TP
.B \fB+ndots=D\fP
Set the number of dots that have to appear in \fBname\fP to \fBD\fP for
it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using
the ndots statement in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP, or 1 if no ndots
statement is present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as
relative names and will be searched for in the domains listed in the
\fBsearch\fP or \fBdomain\fP directive in \fB/etc/resolv.conf\fP if
\fB+search\fP is set.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]nsid\fP
Include an EDNS name server ID request when sending a query.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]nssearch\fP
When this option is set, \fBdig\fP attempts to find the authoritative
name servers for the zone containing the name being looked up and
display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone.
Addresses of servers that that did not respond are also printed.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]onesoa\fP
Print only one (starting) SOA record when performing an AXFR. The
default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]opcode=value\fP
Set [restore] the DNS message opcode to the specified value. The
default value is QUERY (0).
.TP
.B \fB+padding=value\fP
Pad the size of the query packet using the EDNS Padding option to
blocks of \fBvalue\fP bytes. For example, \fB+padding=32\fP would cause a
48\-byte query to be padded to 64 bytes. The default block size is 0,
which disables padding. The maximum is 512. Values are ordinarily
expected to be powers of two, such as 128; however, this is not
mandatory. Responses to padded queries may also be padded, but only
if the query uses TCP or DNS COOKIE.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]qr\fP
Toggles the display of the query message as it is sent. By default, the query
is not printed.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]question\fP
Toggles the display of the question section of a query when an answer is
returned.  The default is to print the question section as a comment.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]raflag\fP
Set [do not set] the RA (Recursion Available) bit in the query. The
default is +noraflag. This bit should be ignored by the server for
QUERY.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]rdflag\fP
A synonym for \fB+[no]recurse\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]recurse\fP
Toggle the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query.
This bit is set by default, which means \fBdig\fP normally sends
recursive queries. Recursion is automatically disabled when the
\fB+nssearch\fP or \fB+trace\fP query options are used.
.TP
.B \fB+retry=T\fP
Sets the number of times to retry UDP queries to server to \fBT\fP
instead of the default, 2. Unlike \fB+tries\fP, this does not include
the initial query.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]rrcomments\fP
Toggle the display of per\-record comments in the output (for example,
human\-readable key information about DNSKEY records). The default is
not to print record comments unless multiline mode is active.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]search\fP
Use [do not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or domain
directive in \fBresolv.conf\fP (if any). The search list is not used by
default.
.sp
\(aqndots\(aq from \fBresolv.conf\fP (default 1) which may be overridden by
\fB+ndots\fP determines if the name will be treated as relative or not
and hence whether a search is eventually performed or not.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]short\fP
Provide a terse answer.  The default is to print the answer in a verbose
form.  This option always has global effect; it cannot be set globally and
then overridden on a per\-lookup basis.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]showsearch\fP
Perform [do not perform] a search showing intermediate results.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]sigchase\fP
This feature is now obsolete and has been removed; use \fBdelv\fP
instead.
.TP
.B \fB+split=W\fP
Split long hex\- or base64\-formatted fields in resource records into
chunks of \fBW\fP characters (where \fBW\fP is rounded up to the nearest
multiple of 4). \fB+nosplit\fP or \fB+split=0\fP causes fields not to be
split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when
multiline mode is active.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]stats\fP
Toggles the printing of statistics: when the query was made, the size of the
reply and so on.  The default behavior is to print the query statistics as a
comment after each lookup.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]subnet=addr[/prefix\-length]\fP
Send (don\(aqt send) an EDNS Client Subnet option with the specified IP
address or network prefix.
.sp
\fBdig +subnet=0.0.0.0/0\fP, or simply \fBdig +subnet=0\fP for short,
sends an EDNS CLIENT\-SUBNET option with an empty address and a source
prefix\-length of zero, which signals a resolver that the client\(aqs
address information must \fInot\fP be used when resolving this query.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]tcflag\fP
Set [do not set] the TC (TrunCation) bit in the query. The default is
+notcflag. This bit should be ignored by the server for QUERY.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]tcp\fP
Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. The default behavior
is to use UDP unless a type \fBany\fP or \fBixfr=N\fP query is requested,
in which case the default is TCP. AXFR queries always use TCP.
.TP
.B \fB+timeout=T\fP
Sets the timeout for a query to \fBT\fP seconds. The default timeout is
5 seconds. An attempt to set \fBT\fP to less than 1 will result in a
query timeout of 1 second being applied.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]topdown\fP
This feature is related to \fBdig +sigchase\fP, which is obsolete and
has been removed. Use \fBdelv\fP instead.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]trace\fP
Toggle tracing of the delegation path from the root name servers for
the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When
tracing is enabled, \fBdig\fP makes iterative queries to resolve the
name being looked up. It will follow referrals from the root servers,
showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the
lookup.
.sp
If @server is also specified, it affects only the initial query for
the root zone name servers.
.sp
\fB+dnssec\fP is also set when +trace is set to better emulate the
default queries from a nameserver.
.TP
.B \fB+tries=T\fP
Sets the number of times to try UDP queries to server to \fBT\fP
instead of the default, 3. If \fBT\fP is less than or equal to zero,
the number of tries is silently rounded up to 1.
.TP
.B \fB+trusted\-key=####\fP
Formerly specified trusted keys for use with \fBdig +sigchase\fP\&. This
feature is now obsolete and has been removed; use \fBdelv\fP instead.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ttlid\fP
Display [do not display] the TTL when printing the record.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]ttlunits\fP
Display [do not display] the TTL in friendly human\-readable time
units of "s", "m", "h", "d", and "w", representing seconds, minutes,
hours, days and weeks. Implies +ttlid.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]unexpected\fP
Accept [do not accept] answers from unexpected sources.  By default, \fBdig\fP
won\(aqt accept a reply from a source other than the one to which it sent the
query.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]unknownformat\fP
Print all RDATA in unknown RR type presentation format (\fI\%RFC 3597\fP).
The default is to print RDATA for known types in the type\(aqs
presentation format.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]vc\fP
Use [do not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate
syntax to \fB+[no]tcp\fP is provided for backwards compatibility. The
"vc" stands for "virtual circuit".
.TP
.B \fB+[no]yaml\fP
Print the responses (and, if <option>+qr</option> is in use, also the
outgoing queries) in a detailed YAML format.
.TP
.B \fB+[no]zflag\fP
Set [do not set] the last unassigned DNS header flag in a DNS query.
This flag is off by default.
.UNINDENT
.SH MULTIPLE QUERIES
.sp
The BIND 9 implementation of \fBdig\fP supports specifying multiple
queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the \fB\-f\fP batch
file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of
flags, options and query options.
.sp
In this case, each \fBquery\fP argument represent an individual query in
the command\-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the
standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query
type and class and any query options that should be applied to that
query.
.sp
A global set of query options, which should be applied to all queries,
can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first
tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options supplied
on the command line. Any global query options (except \fB+[no]cmd\fP and
\fB+[no]short\fP options) can be overridden by a query\-specific set of
query options. For example:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
dig +qr www.isc.org any \-x 127.0.0.1 isc.org ns +noqr
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
shows how \fBdig\fP could be used from the command line to make three
lookups: an ANY query for \fBwww.isc.org\fP, a reverse lookup of 127.0.0.1
and a query for the NS records of \fBisc.org\fP\&. A global query option of
\fB+qr\fP is applied, so that \fBdig\fP shows the initial query it made for
each lookup. The final query has a local query option of \fB+noqr\fP which
means that \fBdig\fP will not print the initial query when it looks up the
NS records for \fBisc.org\fP\&.
.SH IDN SUPPORT
.sp
If \fBdig\fP has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name)
support, it can accept and display non\-ASCII domain names. \fBdig\fP
