.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP generates a key pair of files that referencing a
key object stored in a cryptographic hardware service module (HSM). The
private key file can be used for DNSSEC signing of zone data as if it
were a conventional signing key created by \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP, but the
key material is stored within the HSM, and the actual signing takes
place there.
.sp
The \fBname\fP of the key is specified on the command line. This must
match the name of the zone for which the key is being generated.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP algorithm
Selects the cryptographic algorithm. The value of \fBalgorithm\fP must
be one of RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256, RSASHA512,
ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519 or ED448.
.sp
If no algorithm is specified, then RSASHA1 will be used by default,
unless the \fB\-3\fP option is specified, in which case NSEC3RSASHA1
will be used instead. (If \fB\-3\fP is used and an algorithm is
specified, that algorithm will be checked for compatibility with
NSEC3.)
.sp
These values are case insensitive. In some cases, abbreviations are
supported, such as ECDSA256 for ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSA384 for
ECDSAP384SHA384. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the \fB\-3\fP
option, then NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead.
.sp
As of BIND 9.12.0, this option is mandatory except when using the
\fB\-S\fP option (which copies the algorithm from the predecessory key).
Previously, the default for newly generated keys was RSASHA1.
.TP
\fB\-3\fP
Use an NSEC3\-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this
option is used with an algorithm that has both NSEC and NSEC3
versions, then the NSEC3 version will be used; for example,
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-3a RSASHA1\fP specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1 algorithm.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP engine
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the
string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a
cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
"\-\-with\-pkcs11".
.TP
\fB\-l\fP label
Specifies the label for a key pair in the crypto hardware.
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with OpenSSL\-based PKCS#11 support, the label is
an arbitrary string that identifies a particular key. It may be
preceded by an optional OpenSSL engine name, followed by a colon, as
in "pkcs11:keylabel".
.sp
When BIND 9 is built with native PKCS#11 support, the label is a
PKCS#11 URI string in the format
"pkcs11:\fBkeyword\fP=value[;\fBkeyword\fP=value;...]" Keywords
include "token", which identifies the HSM; "object", which identifies
the key; and "pin\-source", which identifies a file from which the
HSM\(aqs PIN code can be obtained. The label will be stored in the
on\-disk "private" file.
.sp
If the label contains a \fBpin\-source\fP field, tools using the
generated key files will be able to use the HSM for signing and other
operations without any need for an operator to manually enter a PIN.
Note: Making the HSM\(aqs PIN accessible in this manner may reduce the
security advantage of using an HSM; be sure this is what you want to
do before making use of this feature.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP nametype
Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of \fBnametype\fP must
either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY
(for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated
with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case
insensitive.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Compatibility mode: generates an old\-style key, without any metadata.
By default, \fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP will include the key\(aqs creation
date in the metadata stored with the private key, and other dates may
be set there as well (publication date, activation date, etc). Keys
that include this data may be incompatible with older versions of
BIND; the \fB\-C\fP option suppresses them.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the
specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP flag
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record.
The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE.
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This option is
incompatible with \-P and \-A.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP directory
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP
Generate KEY records rather than DNSKEY records.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP ttl
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that
will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. Setting
the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP removes it.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP protocol
Sets the protocol value for the key. The protocol is a number between
0 and 255. The default is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this
argument are listed in \fI\%RFC 2535\fP and its successors.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP key
Generate a key as an explicit successor to an existing key. The name,
algorithm, size, and type of the key will be set to match the
predecessor. The activation date of the new key will be set to the
inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date will be
set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval, which
defaults to 30 days.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP type
Indicates the use of the key. \fBtype\fP must be one of AUTHCONF,
NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers
to the ability to authenticate data, and CONF the ability to encrypt
data.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP level
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Prints version information.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP
Allows DNSSEC key files to be generated even if the key ID would
collide with that of an existing key, in the event of either key
being revoked. (This is only safe to use if you are sure you won\(aqt be
using \fI\%RFC 5011\fP trust anchor maintenance with either of the keys
involved.)
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
argument begins with a \(aq+\(aq or \(aq\-\(aq, it is interpreted as an offset from
the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
of the suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the offset is
computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \(aqnone\(aq or \(aqnever\(aq.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-P\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used
to sign it. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the
default is "now".
.TP
\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records which match this
key are to be published to the zone.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it. If not set,
and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now".
.TP
\fB\-R\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the
key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone and
will be used to sign it.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the
key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to
sign it.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key
repository, however.)
.TP
\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records which match this
key are to be deleted.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP interval
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
date isn\(aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time
before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but activation date isn\(aqt, then activation will be set to
this much time after publication.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERATED KEY FILES
.sp
When \fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP completes successfully, it prints a string
of the form \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fP to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key files it has generated.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnnnn\fP is the key name.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaaa\fP is the numeric representation of the algorithm.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBiiiii\fP is the key identifier (or footprint).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keyfromlabel\fP creates two files, with names based on the
printed string. \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP contains the public key, and
\fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private\fP contains the private key.
.sp
The \fB\&.key\fP file contains a DNS KEY record that can be inserted into a
zone file (directly or with a $INCLUDE statement).
.sp
The \fB\&.private\fP file contains algorithm\-specific fields. For obvious
security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.
