.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP generates keys for DNSSEC (Secure DNS), as defined in
\fI\%RFC 2535\fP and \fI\%RFC 4034\fP\&. It can also generate keys for use with TSIG
(Transaction Signatures) as defined in \fI\%RFC 2845\fP, or TKEY (Transaction
Key) as defined in \fI\%RFC 2930\fP\&.
.sp
The \fBname\fP of the key is specified on the command line. For DNSSEC
keys, this must match the name of the zone for which the key is being
generated.
.sp
The \fBdnssec\-keymgr\fP command acts as a wrapper
around \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP, generating and updating keys
as needed to enforce defined security policies such as key rollover
scheduling. Using \fBdnssec\-keymgr\fP may be preferable
to direct use of \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-3\fP
Use an NSEC3\-capable algorithm to generate a DNSSEC key. If this
option is used with an algorithm that has both NSEC and NSEC3
versions, then the NSEC3 version will be used; for example,
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-3a RSASHA1\fP specifies the NSEC3RSASHA1 algorithm.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP algorithm
Selects the cryptographic algorithm. For DNSSEC keys, the value of
\fBalgorithm\fP must be one of RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASHA1, RSASHA256,
RSASHA512, ECDSAP256SHA256, ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519 or ED448. For
TKEY, the value must be DH (Diffie Hellman); specifying his value
will automatically set the \fB\-T KEY\fP option as well.
.sp
These values are case insensitive. In some cases, abbreviations are
supported, such as ECDSA256 for ECDSAP256SHA256 and ECDSA384 for
ECDSAP384SHA384. If RSASHA1 is specified along with the \fB\-3\fP
option, then NSEC3RSASHA1 will be used instead.
.sp
This parameter \fImust\fP be specified except when using the \fB\-S\fP
option, which copies the algorithm from the predecessor key.
.sp
In prior releases, HMAC algorithms could be generated for use as TSIG
keys, but that feature has been removed as of BIND 9.13.0. Use
\fBtsig\-keygen\fP to generate TSIG keys.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP keysize
Specifies the number of bits in the key. The choice of key size
depends on the algorithm used. RSA keys must be between 1024 and 4096
bits. Diffie Hellman keys must be between 128 and 4096 bits. Elliptic
curve algorithms don\(aqt need this parameter.
.sp
If the key size is not specified, some algorithms have pre\-defined
defaults. For example, RSA keys for use as DNSSEC zone signing keys
have a default size of 1024 bits; RSA keys for use as key signing
keys (KSKs, generated with \fB\-f KSK\fP) default to 2048 bits.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Compatibility mode: generates an old\-style key, without any timing
metadata. By default, \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP will include the key\(aqs
creation date in the metadata stored with the private key, and other
dates may be set there as well (publication date, activation date,
etc). Keys that include this data may be incompatible with older
versions of BIND; the \fB\-C\fP option suppresses them.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Indicates that the DNS record containing the key should have the
specified class. If not specified, class IN is used.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP bits
Key size in bits. For the algorithms RSASHA1, NSEC3RSASA1, RSASHA256 and
RSASHA512 the key size must be in range 1024\-4096.  DH size is between 128
and 4096. This option is ignored for algorithms ECDSAP256SHA256,
ECDSAP384SHA384, ED25519 and ED448.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP engine
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the
string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a
cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
"\-\-with\-pkcs11".
.TP
\fB\-f\fP flag
Set the specified flag in the flag field of the KEY/DNSKEY record.
The only recognized flags are KSK (Key Signing Key) and REVOKE.
.TP
\fB\-G\fP
Generate a key, but do not publish it or sign with it. This option is
incompatible with \-P and \-A.
.TP
\fB\-g\fP generator
If generating a Diffie Hellman key, use this generator. Allowed
values are 2 and 5. If no generator is specified, a known prime from
\fI\%RFC 2539\fP will be used if possible; otherwise the default is 2.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP directory
Sets the directory in which the key files are to be written.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP policy
Create keys for a specific dnssec\-policy.  If a policy uses multiple keys,
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP will generate multiple keys.  This will also
create a ".state" file to keep track of the key state.
.sp
This option creates keys according to the dnssec\-policy configuration, hence
it cannot be used together with many of the other options that
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP provides.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP ttl
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that
will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. If this
value is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL will
default to the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP
is the same as leaving it unset.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP file
Provide a configuration file that contains a dnssec\-policy statement
(matching the policy set with \fB\-k\fP).
.TP
\fB\-n\fP nametype
Specifies the owner type of the key. The value of \fBnametype\fP must
either be ZONE (for a DNSSEC zone key (KEY/DNSKEY)), HOST or ENTITY
(for a key associated with a host (KEY)), USER (for a key associated
with a user(KEY)) or OTHER (DNSKEY). These values are case
insensitive. Defaults to ZONE for DNSKEY generation.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP protocol
Sets the protocol value for the generated key, for use with
\fB\-T KEY\fP\&. The protocol is a number between 0 and 255. The default
is 3 (DNSSEC). Other possible values for this argument are listed in
\fI\%RFC 2535\fP and its successors.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Quiet mode: Suppresses unnecessary output, including progress
indication. Without this option, when \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP is run
interactively to generate an RSA or DSA key pair, it will print a
string of symbols to \fBstderr\fP indicating the progress of the key
generation. A \(aq.\(aq indicates that a random number has been found which
passed an initial sieve test; \(aq+\(aq means a number has passed a single
round of the Miller\-Rabin primality test; a space means that the
number has passed all the tests and is a satisfactory key.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP key
Create a new key which is an explicit successor to an existing key.
The name, algorithm, size, and type of the key will be set to match
the existing key. The activation date of the new key will be set to
the inactivation date of the existing one. The publication date will
be set to the activation date minus the prepublication interval,
which defaults to 30 days.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP strength
Specifies the strength value of the key. The strength is a number
between 0 and 15, and currently has no defined purpose in DNSSEC.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP rrtype
Specifies the resource record type to use for the key. \fBrrtype\fP
must be either DNSKEY or KEY. The default is DNSKEY when using a
DNSSEC algorithm, but it can be overridden to KEY for use with
SIG(0).
.TP
\fB\-t\fP type
Indicates the use of the key, for use with \fB\-T  KEY\fP\&. \fBtype\fP
must be one of AUTHCONF, NOAUTHCONF, NOAUTH, or NOCONF. The default
is AUTHCONF. AUTH refers to the ability to authenticate data, and
CONF the ability to encrypt data.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Prints version information.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP level
Sets the debugging level.
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
argument begins with a \(aq+\(aq or \(aq\-\(aq, it is interpreted as an offset from
the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
of the suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the offset is
computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
explicitly prevent a date from being set, use \(aqnone\(aq or \(aqnever\(aq.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-P\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used
to sign it. If not set, and if the \-G option has not been used, the
default is "now".
.TP
\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
are to be published to the zone.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it. If not set,
and if the \-G option has not been used, the default is "now". If set,
if and \-P is not set, then the publication date will be set to the
activation date minus the prepublication interval.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the
key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone and
will be used to sign it.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the
key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to
sign it.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key
repository, however.)
.TP
\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
key are to be deleted.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP interval
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
date isn\(aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time
before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but activation date isn\(aqt, then activation will be set to
this much time after publication.
.sp
If the key is being created as an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.
.UNINDENT
.SH GENERATED KEYS
.sp
When \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP completes successfully, it prints a string of the
form \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii\fP to the standard output. This is an
identification string for the key it has generated.
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBnnnn\fP is the key name.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBaaa\fP is the numeric representation of the algorithm.
.IP \(bu 2
\fBiiiii\fP is the key identifier (or footprint).
.UNINDENT
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP creates two files, with names based on the printed
string. \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP contains the public key, and
\fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private\fP contains the private key.
.sp
The \fB\&.key\fP file contains a DNSKEY or KEY record. When a zone is being
signed by \fBnamed\fP or \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP \fB\-S\fP, DNSKEY records are
included automatically. In other cases, the \fB\&.key\fP file can be
inserted into a zone file manually or with a \fB$INCLUDE\fP statement.
.sp
The \fB\&.private\fP file contains algorithm\-specific fields. For obvious
security reasons, this file does not have general read permission.
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
To generate an ECDSAP256SHA256 zone\-signing key for the zone
\fBexample.com\fP, issue the command:
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-a ECDSAP256SHA256 example.com\fP
.sp
The command would print a string of the form:
.sp
\fBKexample.com.+013+26160\fP
.sp
In this example, \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP creates the files
\fBKexample.com.+013+26160.key\fP and \fBKexample.com.+013+26160.private\fP\&.
.sp
To generate a matching key\-signing key, issue the command:
.sp
\fBdnssec\-keygen \-a ECDSAP256SHA256 \-f KSK example.com\fP
