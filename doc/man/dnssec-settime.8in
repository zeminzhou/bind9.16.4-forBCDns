.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-settime\fP reads a DNSSEC private key file and sets the key
timing metadata as specified by the \fB\-P\fP, \fB\-A\fP, \fB\-R\fP, \fB\-I\fP, and
\fB\-D\fP options. The metadata can then be used by \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP or
other signing software to determine when a key is to be published,
whether it should be used for signing a zone, etc.
.sp
If none of these options is set on the command line, then
\fBdnssec\-settime\fP simply prints the key timing metadata already stored
in the key.
.sp
When key metadata fields are changed, both files of a key pair
(\fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.key\fP and \fBKnnnn.+aaa+iiiii.private\fP) are
regenerated.
.sp
Metadata fields are stored in the private file. A
human\-readable description of the metadata is also placed in comments in
the key file. The private file\(aqs permissions are always set to be
inaccessible to anyone other than the owner (mode 0600).
.sp
When working with state files, it is possible to update the timing metadata in
those files as well with \fB\-s\fP\&.  If this option is used you can also update key
states with \fB\-d\fP (DS), \fB\-k\fP (DNSKEY), \fB\-r\fP (RRSIG of KSK), or \fB\-z\fP
(RRSIG of ZSK). Allowed states are HIDDEN, RUMOURED, OMNIPRESENT, and
UNRETENTIVE.
.sp
You can also set the goal state of the key with \fB\-g\fP\&.  This should be either
HIDDEN or OMNIPRESENT (representing whether the key should be removed from the
zone, or published).
.sp
It is NOT RECOMMENDED to manipulate state files manually except for testing
purposes.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
Force an update of an old\-format key with no metadata fields. Without
this option, \fBdnssec\-settime\fP will fail when attempting to update a
legacy key. With this option, the key will be recreated in the new
format, but with the original key data retained. The key\(aqs creation
date will be set to the present time. If no other values are
specified, then the key\(aqs publication and activation dates will also
be set to the present time.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP directory
Sets the directory in which the key files are to reside.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP ttl
Sets the default TTL to use for this key when it is converted into a
DNSKEY RR. If the key is imported into a zone, this is the TTL that
will be used for it, unless there was already a DNSKEY RRset in
place, in which case the existing TTL would take precedence. If this
value is not set and there is no existing DNSKEY RRset, the TTL will
default to the SOA TTL. Setting the default TTL to \fB0\fP or \fBnone\fP
removes it from the key.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Emit usage message and exit.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Prints version information.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP level
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP engine
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the
string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a
cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
"\-\-with\-pkcs11".
.UNINDENT
.SH TIMING OPTIONS
.sp
Dates can be expressed in the format YYYYMMDD or YYYYMMDDHHMMSS. If the
argument begins with a \(aq+\(aq or \(aq\-\(aq, it is interpreted as an offset from
the present time. For convenience, if such an offset is followed by one
of the suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the offset is
computed in years (defined as 365 24\-hour days, ignoring leap years),
months (defined as 30 24\-hour days), weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the offset is computed in seconds. To
unset a date, use \(aqnone\(aq or \(aqnever\(aq.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-P\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which a key is to be published to the zone. After
that date, the key will be included in the zone but will not be used
to sign it.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this key
are to be published to the zone.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be activated. After that date,
the key will be included in the zone and used to sign it.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be revoked. After that date, the
key will be flagged as revoked. It will be included in the zone and
will be used to sign it.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be retired. After that date, the
key will still be included in the zone, but it will not be used to
sign it.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP date/offset
Sets the date on which the key is to be deleted. After that date, the
key will no longer be included in the zone. (It may remain in the key
repository, however.)
.TP
\fB\-D\fP sync date/offset
Sets the date on which the CDS and CDNSKEY records that match this
key are to be deleted.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP predecessor key
Select a key for which the key being modified will be an explicit
successor. The name, algorithm, size, and type of the predecessor key
must exactly match those of the key being modified. The activation
date of the successor key will be set to the inactivation date of the
predecessor. The publication date will be set to the activation date
minus the prepublication interval, which defaults to 30 days.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP interval
Sets the prepublication interval for a key. If set, then the
publication and activation dates must be separated by at least this
much time. If the activation date is specified but the publication
date isn\(aqt, then the publication date will default to this much time
before the activation date; conversely, if the publication date is
specified but activation date isn\(aqt, then activation will be set to
this much time after publication.
.sp
If the key is being set to be an explicit successor to another key,
then the default prepublication interval is 30 days; otherwise it is
zero.
.sp
As with date offsets, if the argument is followed by one of the
suffixes \(aqy\(aq, \(aqmo\(aq, \(aqw\(aq, \(aqd\(aq, \(aqh\(aq, or \(aqmi\(aq, then the interval is
measured in years, months, weeks, days, hours, or minutes,
respectively. Without a suffix, the interval is measured in seconds.
.UNINDENT
