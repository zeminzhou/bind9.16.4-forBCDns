.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP signs a zone. It generates NSEC and RRSIG records
and produces a signed version of the zone. The security status of
delegations from the signed zone (that is, whether the child zones are
secure or not) is determined by the presence or absence of a \fBkeyset\fP
file for each child zone.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Verify all generated signatures.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Specifies the DNS class of the zone.
.TP
\fB\-C\fP
Compatibility mode: Generate a \fBkeyset\-zonename\fP file in addition
to \fBdsset\-zonename\fP when signing a zone, for use by older versions
of \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP directory
Look for \fBdsset\-\fP or \fBkeyset\-\fP files in \fBdirectory\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Output only those record types automatically managed by
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP, i.e. RRSIG, NSEC, NSEC3 and NSEC3PARAM records.
If smart signing (\fB\-S\fP) is used, DNSKEY records are also included.
The resulting file can be included in the original zone file with
\fB$INCLUDE\fP\&. This option cannot be combined with \fB\-O raw\fP,
\fB\-O map\fP, or serial number updating.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP engine
When applicable, specifies the hardware to use for cryptographic
operations, such as a secure key store used for signing.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the
string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a
cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
"\-\-with\-pkcs11".
.TP
\fB\-g\fP
Generate DS records for child zones from \fBdsset\-\fP or \fBkeyset\-\fP
file. Existing DS records will be removed.
.TP
\fB\-K\fP directory
Key repository: Specify a directory to search for DNSSEC keys. If not
specified, defaults to the current directory.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP key
Treat specified key as a key signing key ignoring any key flags. This
option may be specified multiple times.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP maxttl
Sets the maximum TTL for the signed zone. Any TTL higher than maxttl
in the input zone will be reduced to maxttl in the output. This
provides certainty as to the largest possible TTL in the signed zone,
which is useful to know when rolling keys because it is the longest
possible time before signatures that have been retrieved by resolvers
will expire from resolver caches. Zones that are signed with this
option should be configured to use a matching \fBmax\-zone\-ttl\fP in
\fBnamed.conf\fP\&. (Note: This option is incompatible with \fB\-D\fP,
because it modifies non\-DNSSEC data in the output zone.)
.TP
\fB\-s\fP start\-time
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records become
valid. This can be either an absolute or relative time. An absolute
start time is indicated by a number in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation;
20000530144500 denotes 14:45:00 UTC on May 30th, 2000. A relative
start time is indicated by +N, which is N seconds from the current
time. If no \fBstart\-time\fP is specified, the current time minus 1
hour (to allow for clock skew) is used.
.TP
\fB\-e\fP end\-time
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records expire. As
with \fBstart\-time\fP, an absolute time is indicated in YYYYMMDDHHMMSS
notation. A time relative to the start time is indicated with +N,
which is N seconds from the start time. A time relative to the
current time is indicated with now+N. If no \fBend\-time\fP is
specified, 30 days from the start time is used as a default.
\fBend\-time\fP must be later than \fBstart\-time\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-X\fP extended end\-time
Specify the date and time when the generated RRSIG records for the
DNSKEY RRset will expire. This is to be used in cases when the DNSKEY
signatures need to persist longer than signatures on other records;
e.g., when the private component of the KSK is kept offline and the
KSK signature is to be refreshed manually.
.sp
As with \fBstart\-time\fP, an absolute time is indicated in
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS notation. A time relative to the start time is
indicated with +N, which is N seconds from the start time. A time
relative to the current time is indicated with now+N. If no
\fBextended end\-time\fP is specified, the value of \fBend\-time\fP is used
as the default. (\fBend\-time\fP, in turn, defaults to 30 days from the
start time.) \fBextended end\-time\fP must be later than \fBstart\-time\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP output\-file
The name of the output file containing the signed zone. The default
is to append \fB\&.signed\fP to the input filename. If \fBoutput\-file\fP is
set to \fB"\-"\fP, then the signed zone is written to the standard
output, with a default output format of "full".
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Prints version information.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP interval
When a previously\-signed zone is passed as input, records may be
resigned. The \fBinterval\fP option specifies the cycle interval as an
offset from the current time (in seconds). If a RRSIG record expires
after the cycle interval, it is retained. Otherwise, it is considered
to be expiring soon, and it will be replaced.
.sp
The default cycle interval is one quarter of the difference between
the signature end and start times. So if neither \fBend\-time\fP or
\fBstart\-time\fP are specified, \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP generates
signatures that are valid for 30 days, with a cycle interval of 7.5
days. Therefore, if any existing RRSIG records are due to expire in
less than 7.5 days, they would be replaced.
.TP
\fB\-I\fP input\-format
The format of the input zone file. Possible formats are \fB"text"\fP
(default), \fB"raw"\fP, and \fB"map"\fP\&. This option is primarily
intended to be used for dynamic signed zones so that the dumped zone
file in a non\-text format containing updates can be signed directly.
The use of this option does not make much sense for non\-dynamic
zones.
.TP
\fB\-j\fP jitter
When signing a zone with a fixed signature lifetime, all RRSIG
records issued at the time of signing expires simultaneously. If the
zone is incrementally signed, i.e. a previously\-signed zone is passed
as input to the signer, all expired signatures have to be regenerated
at about the same time. The \fBjitter\fP option specifies a jitter
window that will be used to randomize the signature expire time, thus
spreading incremental signature regeneration over time.
.sp
Signature lifetime jitter also to some extent benefits validators and
servers by spreading out cache expiration, i.e. if large numbers of
RRSIGs don\(aqt expire at the same time from all caches there will be
less congestion than if all validators need to refetch at mostly the
same time.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP serial
When writing a signed zone to "raw" or "map" format, set the "source
serial" value in the header to the specified serial number. (This is
expected to be used primarily for testing purposes.)
.TP
\fB\-n\fP ncpus
Specifies the number of threads to use. By default, one thread is
started for each detected CPU.
.TP
\fB\-N\fP soa\-serial\-format
The SOA serial number format of the signed zone. Possible formats are
\fB"keep"\fP (default), \fB"increment"\fP, \fB"unixtime"\fP, and
\fB"date"\fP\&.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fB"keep"\fP
Do not modify the SOA serial number.
.TP
.B \fB"increment"\fP
Increment the SOA serial number using \fI\%RFC 1982\fP arithmetic.
.TP
.B \fB"unixtime"\fP
Set the SOA serial number to the number of seconds since epoch.
.TP
.B \fB"date"\fP
Set the SOA serial number to today\(aqs date in YYYYMMDDNN format.
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fB\-o\fP origin
The zone origin. If not specified, the name of the zone file is
assumed to be the origin.
.TP
\fB\-O\fP output\-format
The format of the output file containing the signed zone. Possible
formats are \fB"text"\fP (default), which is the standard textual
representation of the zone; \fB"full"\fP, which is text output in a
format suitable for processing by external scripts; and \fB"map"\fP,
\fB"raw"\fP, and \fB"raw=N"\fP, which store the zone in binary formats
for rapid loading by \fBnamed\fP\&. \fB"raw=N"\fP specifies the format
version of the raw zone file: if N is 0, the raw file can be read by
any version of \fBnamed\fP; if N is 1, the file can be read by release
9.9.0 or higher; the default is 1.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP
Disable post sign verification tests.
.sp
The post sign verification test ensures that for each algorithm in
use there is at least one non revoked self signed KSK key, that all
revoked KSK keys are self signed, and that all records in the zone
are signed by the algorithm. This option skips these tests.
.TP
\fB\-Q\fP
Remove signatures from keys that are no longer active.
.sp
Normally, when a previously\-signed zone is passed as input to the
signer, and a DNSKEY record has been removed and replaced with a new
one, signatures from the old key that are still within their validity
period are retained. This allows the zone to continue to validate
with cached copies of the old DNSKEY RRset. The \fB\-Q\fP forces
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP to remove signatures from keys that are no longer
active. This enables ZSK rollover using the procedure described in
\fI\%RFC 4641#4.2.1.1\fP ("Pre\-Publish Key Rollover").
.TP
.B \fB\-q\fP
Quiet mode: Suppresses unnecessary output.  Without this option, when
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP is run it will print to standard output the number of
keys in use, the algorithms used to verify the zone was signed correctly and
other status information, and finally the filename containing the signed
zone.  With it, that output is suppressed, leaving only the filename.
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
Remove signatures from keys that are no longer published.
.sp
This option is similar to \fB\-Q\fP, except it forces
\fBdnssec\-signzone\fP to signatures from keys that are no longer
published. This enables ZSK rollover using the procedure described in
\fI\%RFC 4641#4.2.1.2\fP ("Double Signature Zone Signing Key
Rollover").
.TP
\fB\-S\fP
Smart signing: Instructs \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP to search the key
repository for keys that match the zone being signed, and to include
them in the zone if appropriate.
.sp
When a key is found, its timing metadata is examined to determine how
it should be used, according to the following rules. Each successive
rule takes priority over the prior ones:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
If no timing metadata has been set for the key, the key is
published in the zone and used to sign the zone.
.sp
If the key\(aqs publication date is set and is in the past, the key
is published in the zone.
.sp
If the key\(aqs activation date is set and in the past, the key is
published (regardless of publication date) and used to sign the
zone.
.sp
If the key\(aqs revocation date is set and in the past, and the key
is published, then the key is revoked, and the revoked key is used
to sign the zone.
.sp
If either of the key\(aqs unpublication or deletion dates are set and
in the past, the key is NOT published or used to sign the zone,
regardless of any other metadata.
.sp
If key\(aqs sync publication date is set and in the past,
synchronization records (type CDS and/or CDNSKEY) are created.
.sp
If key\(aqs sync deletion date is set and in the past,
synchronization records (type CDS and/or CDNSKEY) are removed.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
\fB\-T\fP ttl
Specifies a TTL to be used for new DNSKEY records imported into the
zone from the key repository. If not specified, the default is the
TTL value from the zone\(aqs SOA record. This option is ignored when
signing without \fB\-S\fP, since DNSKEY records are not imported from
the key repository in that case. It is also ignored if there are any
pre\-existing DNSKEY records at the zone apex, in which case new
records\(aq TTL values will be set to match them, or if any of the
imported DNSKEY records had a default TTL value. In the event of a a
conflict between TTL values in imported keys, the shortest one is
used.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
Print statistics at completion.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP
Update NSEC/NSEC3 chain when re\-signing a previously signed zone.
With this option, a zone signed with NSEC can be switched to NSEC3,
or a zone signed with NSEC3 can be switch to NSEC or to NSEC3 with
different parameters. Without this option, \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP will
retain the existing chain when re\-signing.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP level
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
Only sign the DNSKEY, CDNSKEY, and CDS RRsets with key\-signing keys,
and omit signatures from zone\-signing keys. (This is similar to the
\fBdnssec\-dnskey\-kskonly yes;\fP zone option in \fBnamed\fP\&.)
.TP
\fB\-z\fP
Ignore KSK flag on key when determining what to sign. This causes
KSK\-flagged keys to sign all records, not just the DNSKEY RRset.
(This is similar to the \fBupdate\-check\-ksk no;\fP zone option in
\fBnamed\fP\&.)
.TP
\fB\-3\fP salt
Generate an NSEC3 chain with the given hex encoded salt. A dash
(salt) can be used to indicate that no salt is to be used when
generating the NSEC3 chain.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP iterations
When generating an NSEC3 chain, use this many iterations. The default
is 10.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP
When generating an NSEC3 chain set the OPTOUT flag on all NSEC3
records and do not generate NSEC3 records for insecure delegations.
.sp
Using this option twice (i.e., \fB\-AA\fP) turns the OPTOUT flag off for
all records. This is useful when using the \fB\-u\fP option to modify an
NSEC3 chain which previously had OPTOUT set.
.TP
\fBzonefile\fP
The file containing the zone to be signed.
.TP
\fBkey\fP
Specify which keys should be used to sign the zone. If no keys are
specified, then the zone will be examined for DNSKEY records at the
zone apex. If these are found and there are matching private keys, in
the current directory, then these will be used for signing.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLE
.sp
The following command signs the \fBexample.com\fP zone with the
ECDSAP256SHA256 key generated by key generated by \fBdnssec\-keygen\fP
(Kexample.com.+013+17247). Because the \fB\-S\fP option is not being used,
the zone\(aqs keys must be in the master file (\fBdb.example.com\fP). This
invocation looks for \fBdsset\fP files, in the current directory, so that
DS records can be imported from them (\fB\-g\fP).
