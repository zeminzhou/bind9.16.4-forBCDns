.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBdnssec\-verify\fP [\fB\-c\fP class] [\fB\-E\fP engine] [\fB\-I\fP input\-format] [\fB\-o\fP origin] [\fB\-q\fP] [\fB\-v\fP level] [\fB\-V\fP] [\fB\-x\fP] [\fB\-z\fP] {zonefile}
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBdnssec\-verify\fP verifies that a zone is fully signed for each
algorithm found in the DNSKEY RRset for the zone, and that the NSEC /
NSEC3 chains are complete.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Specifies the DNS class of the zone.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP engine
Specifies the cryptographic hardware to use, when applicable.
.sp
When BIND is built with OpenSSL PKCS#11 support, this defaults to the
string "pkcs11", which identifies an OpenSSL engine that can drive a
cryptographic accelerator or hardware service module. When BIND is
built with native PKCS#11 cryptography (\-\-enable\-native\-pkcs11), it
defaults to the path of the PKCS#11 provider library specified via
"\-\-with\-pkcs11".
.TP
\fB\-I\fP input\-format
The format of the input zone file. Possible formats are \fB"text"\fP
(default) and \fB"raw"\fP\&. This option is primarily intended to be used
for dynamic signed zones so that the dumped zone file in a non\-text
format containing updates can be verified independently. The use of
this option does not make much sense for non\-dynamic zones.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP origin
The zone origin. If not specified, the name of the zone file is
assumed to be the origin.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP level
Sets the debugging level.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Prints version information.
.TP
.B \fB\-q\fP
Quiet mode: Suppresses output.  Without this option, when \fBdnssec\-verify\fP
is run it will print to standard output the number of keys in use, the
algorithms used to verify the zone was signed correctly and other status
information.  With it, all non\-error output is suppressed, and only the exit
code will indicate success.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
Only verify that the DNSKEY RRset is signed with key\-signing keys.
Without this flag, it is assumed that the DNSKEY RRset will be signed
by all active keys. When this flag is set, it will not be an error if
the DNSKEY RRset is not signed by zone\-signing keys. This corresponds
to the \fB\-x\fP option in \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-z\fP
Ignore the KSK flag on the keys when determining whether the zone if
correctly signed. Without this flag it is assumed that there will be
a non\-revoked, self\-signed DNSKEY with the KSK flag set for each
algorithm and that RRsets other than DNSKEY RRset will be signed with
a different DNSKEY without the KSK flag set.
.sp
With this flag set, we only require that for each algorithm, there
will be at least one non\-revoked, self\-signed DNSKEY, regardless of
the KSK flag state, and that other RRsets will be signed by a
non\-revoked key for the same algorithm that includes the self\-signed
key; the same key may be used for both purposes. This corresponds to
the \fB\-z\fP option in \fBdnssec\-signzone\fP\&.
.TP
\fBzonefile\fP
The file containing the zone to be signed.
