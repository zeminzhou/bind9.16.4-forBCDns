.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP checks the syntax and integrity of a zone file. It
performs the same checks as \fBnamed\fP does when loading a zone. This
makes \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP useful for checking zone files before
configuring them into a name server.
.sp
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fP is similar to \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP, but it always
dumps the zone contents to a specified file in a specified format.
Additionally, it applies stricter check levels by default, since the
dump output will be used as an actual zone file loaded by \fBnamed\fP\&.
When manually specified otherwise, the check levels must at least be as
strict as those specified in the \fBnamed\fP configuration file.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Enable debugging.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Print the usage summary and exit.
.TP
\fB\-q\fP
Quiet mode \- exit code only.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Print the version of the \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP program and exit.
.TP
\fB\-j\fP
When loading a zone file, read the journal if it exists. The journal
file name is assumed to be the zone file name appended with the
string \fB\&.jnl\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-J\fP filename
When loading the zone file read the journal from the given file, if
it exists. (Implies \-j.)
.TP
\fB\-c\fP class
Specify the class of the zone. If not specified, "IN" is assumed.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP mode
Perform post\-load zone integrity checks. Possible modes are
\fB"full"\fP (default), \fB"full\-sibling"\fP, \fB"local"\fP,
\fB"local\-sibling"\fP and \fB"none"\fP\&.
.sp
Mode \fB"full"\fP checks that MX records refer to A or AAAA record
(both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode \fB"local"\fP only
checks MX records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode \fB"full"\fP checks that SRV records refer to A or AAAA record
(both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). Mode \fB"local"\fP only
checks SRV records which refer to in\-zone hostnames.
.sp
Mode \fB"full"\fP checks that delegation NS records refer to A or AAAA
record (both in\-zone and out\-of\-zone hostnames). It also checks that
glue address records in the zone match those advertised by the child.
Mode \fB"local"\fP only checks NS records which refer to in\-zone
hostnames or that some required glue exists, that is when the
nameserver is in a child zone.
.sp
Mode \fB"full\-sibling"\fP and \fB"local\-sibling"\fP disable sibling glue
checks but are otherwise the same as \fB"full"\fP and \fB"local"\fP
respectively.
.sp
Mode \fB"none"\fP disables the checks.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP format
Specify the format of the zone file. Possible formats are \fB"text"\fP
(default), \fB"raw"\fP, and \fB"map"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP format
Specify the format of the output file specified. For
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP, this does not cause any effects unless it dumps
the zone contents.
.sp
Possible formats are \fB"text"\fP (default), which is the standard
textual representation of the zone, and \fB"map"\fP, \fB"raw"\fP, and
\fB"raw=N"\fP, which store the zone in a binary format for rapid
loading by \fBnamed\fP\&. \fB"raw=N"\fP specifies the format version of the
raw zone file: if N is 0, the raw file can be read by any version of
\fBnamed\fP; if N is 1, the file can be read by release 9.9.0 or
higher; the default is 1.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP mode
Perform \fB"check\-names"\fP checks with the specified failure mode.
Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fP (default for \fBnamed\-compilezone\fP),
\fB"warn"\fP (default for \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP) and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP ttl
Sets a maximum permissible TTL for the input file. Any record with a
TTL higher than this value will cause the zone to be rejected. This
is similar to using the \fBmax\-zone\-ttl\fP option in \fBnamed.conf\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP serial
When compiling a zone to "raw" or "map" format, set the "source
serial" value in the header to the specified serial number. (This is
expected to be used primarily for testing purposes.)
.TP
\fB\-m\fP mode
Specify whether MX records should be checked to see if they are
addresses. Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fP, \fB"warn"\fP (default) and
\fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-M\fP mode
Check if a MX record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fP, \fB"warn"\fP (default) and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-n\fP mode
Specify whether NS records should be checked to see if they are
addresses. Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fP (default for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fP), \fB"warn"\fP (default for \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP)
and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-o\fP filename
Write zone output to \fBfilename\fP\&. If \fBfilename\fP is \fB\-\fP then
write to standard out. This is mandatory for \fBnamed\-compilezone\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP mode
Check for records that are treated as different by DNSSEC but are
semantically equal in plain DNS. Possible modes are \fB"fail"\fP,
\fB"warn"\fP (default) and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP style
Specify the style of the dumped zone file. Possible styles are
\fB"full"\fP (default) and \fB"relative"\fP\&. The full format is most
suitable for processing automatically by a separate script. On the
other hand, the relative format is more human\-readable and is thus
suitable for editing by hand. For \fBnamed\-checkzone\fP this does not
cause any effects unless it dumps the zone contents. It also does not
have any meaning if the output format is not text.
.TP
\fB\-S\fP mode
Check if a SRV record refers to a CNAME. Possible modes are
\fB"fail"\fP, \fB"warn"\fP (default) and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP directory
Chroot to \fBdirectory\fP so that include directives in the
configuration file are processed as if run by a similarly chrooted
\fBnamed\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP mode
Check if Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records exist and issues a
warning if an SPF\-formatted TXT record is not also present. Possible
modes are \fB"warn"\fP (default), \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-w\fP directory
chdir to \fBdirectory\fP so that relative filenames in master file
$INCLUDE directives work. This is similar to the directory clause in
\fBnamed.conf\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Dump zone file in canonical format. This is always enabled for
\fBnamed\-compilezone\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-W\fP mode
Specify whether to check for non\-terminal wildcards. Non\-terminal
wildcards are almost always the result of a failure to understand the
wildcard matching algorithm (\fI\%RFC 1034\fP). Possible modes are \fB"warn"\fP
(default) and \fB"ignore"\fP\&.
.TP
.B zonename
The domain name of the zone being checked.
.TP
.B filename
The name of the zone file.
.UNINDENT
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
\fBnamed\-checkzone\fP returns an exit status of 1 if errors were detected
and 0 otherwise.
