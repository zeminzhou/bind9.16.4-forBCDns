.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBnslookup\fP [\-option] [name | \-] [server]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBNslookup\fP is a program to query Internet domain name servers.
\fBNslookup\fP has two modes: interactive and non\-interactive. Interactive
mode allows the user to query name servers for information about various
hosts and domains or to print a list of hosts in a domain.
Non\-interactive mode is used to print just the name and requested
information for a host or domain.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.sp
Interactive mode is entered in the following cases:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP a. 3
when no arguments are given (the default name server will be used)
.IP b. 3
when the first argument is a hyphen (\-) and the second argument is
the host name or Internet address of a name server.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Non\-interactive mode is used when the name or Internet address of the
host to be looked up is given as the first argument. The optional second
argument specifies the host name or address of a name server.
.sp
Options can also be specified on the command line if they precede the
arguments and are prefixed with a hyphen. For example, to change the
default query type to host information, and the initial timeout to 10
seconds, type:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
nslookup \-query=hinfo  \-timeout=10
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fB\-version\fP option causes \fBnslookup\fP to print the version number
and immediately exits.
.SH INTERACTIVE COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBhost\fP [server]
Look up information for host using the current default server or
using server, if specified. If host is an Internet address and the
query type is A or PTR, the name of the host is returned. If host is
a name and does not have a trailing period, the search list is used
to qualify the name.
.sp
To look up a host not in the current domain, append a period to the
name.
.TP
.B \fBserver\fP domain | \fBlserver\fP domain
Change the default server to domain; \fBlserver\fP uses the initial
server to look up information about domain, while \fBserver\fP uses the
current default server. If an authoritative answer can\(aqt be found,
the names of servers that might have the answer are returned.

.B \fB?\fP

.TP
.B \fBexit\fP
Exits the program.
.TP
.B \fBset\fP keyword[=value]
This command is used to change state information that affects the
lookups. Valid keywords are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBall\fP
Prints the current values of the frequently used options to
\fBset\fP\&. Information about the current default server and host is
also printed.
.TP
.B \fBclass=\fPvalue
Change the query class to one of:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBIN\fP
the Internet class
.TP
.B \fBCH\fP
the Chaos class
.TP
.B \fBHS\fP
the Hesiod class
.TP
.B \fBANY\fP
wildcard
.UNINDENT
.sp
The class specifies the protocol group of the information.
.sp
(Default = IN; abbreviation = cl)
.TP
.B \fBnodebug\fP
Turn on or off the display of the full response packet and any
intermediate response packets when searching.
.sp
(Default = nodebug; abbreviation = [no]deb)
.TP
.B \fBnod2\fP
Turn debugging mode on or off. This displays more about what
nslookup is doing.
.sp
(Default = nod2)
.TP
.B \fBdomain=\fPname
Sets the search list to name.
.TP
.B \fBnosearch\fP
If the lookup request contains at least one period but doesn\(aqt end
with a trailing period, append the domain names in the domain
search list to the request until an answer is received.
.sp
(Default = search)
.TP
.B \fBport=\fPvalue
Change the default TCP/UDP name server port to value.
.sp
(Default = 53; abbreviation = po)
.TP
.B \fBquerytype=\fPvalue | \fBtype=\fPvalue
Change the type of the information query.
.sp
(Default = A and then AAAA; abbreviations = q, ty)
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
\fBNote:\fP It is only possible to specify one query type, only the default
behavior looks up both when an alternative is not specified.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fBnorecurse\fP
Tell the name server to query other servers if it does not have
the information.
.sp
(Default = recurse; abbreviation = [no]rec)
.TP
.B \fBndots=\fPnumber
Set the number of dots (label separators) in a domain that will
disable searching. Absolute names always stop searching.
.TP
.B \fBretry=\fPnumber
Set the number of retries to number.
.TP
.B \fBtimeout=\fPnumber
Change the initial timeout interval for waiting for a reply to
number seconds.
.TP
.B \fBnovc\fP
Always use a virtual circuit when sending requests to the server.
.sp
(Default = novc)
.TP
.B \fBnofail\fP
Try the next nameserver if a nameserver responds with SERVFAIL or
a referral (nofail) or terminate query (fail) on such a response.
.sp
(Default = nofail)
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.SH RETURN VALUES
.sp
\fBnslookup\fP returns with an exit status of 1 if any query failed, and 0
otherwise.
.SH IDN SUPPORT
.sp
If \fBnslookup\fP has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name)
support, it can accept and display non\-ASCII domain names. \fBnslookup\fP
appropriately converts character encoding of domain name before sending
a request to DNS server or displaying a reply from the server. If you\(aqd
like to turn off the IDN support for some reason, define the IDN_DISABLE
environment variable. The IDN support is disabled if the variable is set
when \fBnslookup\fP runs or when the standard output is not a tty.
