.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBnsupdate\fP is used to submit Dynamic DNS Update requests as defined in
\fI\%RFC 2136\fP to a name server. This allows resource records to be added or
removed from a zone without manually editing the zone file. A single
update request can contain requests to add or remove more than one
resource record.
.sp
Zones that are under dynamic control via \fBnsupdate\fP or a DHCP server
should not be edited by hand. Manual edits could conflict with dynamic
updates and cause data to be lost.
.sp
The resource records that are dynamically added or removed with
\fBnsupdate\fP have to be in the same zone. Requests are sent to the
zone\(aqs master server. This is identified by the MNAME field of the
zone\(aqs SOA record.
.sp
Transaction signatures can be used to authenticate the Dynamic DNS
updates. These use the TSIG resource record type described in \fI\%RFC 2845\fP
or the SIG(0) record described in \fI\%RFC 2535\fP and \fI\%RFC 2931\fP or GSS\-TSIG as
described in \fI\%RFC 3645\fP\&.
.sp
TSIG relies on a shared secret that should only be known to \fBnsupdate\fP
and the name server. For instance, suitable \fBkey\fP and \fBserver\fP
statements would be added to \fB/etc/named.conf\fP so that the name server
can associate the appropriate secret key and algorithm with the IP
address of the client application that will be using TSIG
authentication. You can use \fBddns\-confgen\fP to generate suitable
configuration fragments. \fBnsupdate\fP uses the \fB\-y\fP or \fB\-k\fP options
to provide the TSIG shared secret. These options are mutually exclusive.
.sp
SIG(0) uses public key cryptography. To use a SIG(0) key, the public key
must be stored in a KEY record in a zone served by the name server.
.sp
GSS\-TSIG uses Kerberos credentials. Standard GSS\-TSIG mode is switched
on with the \fB\-g\fP flag. A non\-standards\-compliant variant of GSS\-TSIG
used by Windows 2000 can be switched on with the \fB\-o\fP flag.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-4\fP
Use IPv4 only.
.TP
\fB\-6\fP
Use IPv6 only.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP
Debug mode. This provides tracing information about the update
requests that are made and the replies received from the name server.
.TP
\fB\-D\fP
Extra debug mode.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Force interactive mode, even when standard input is not a terminal.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP keyfile
The file containing the TSIG authentication key. Keyfiles may be in
two formats: a single file containing a \fBnamed.conf\fP\-format \fBkey\fP
statement, which may be generated automatically by \fBddns\-confgen\fP,
or a pair of files whose names are of the format
\fBK{name}.+157.+{random}.key\fP and
\fBK{name}.+157.+{random}.private\fP, which can be generated by
\fBdnssec\-keygen\fP\&. The \fB\-k\fP may also be used to specify a SIG(0)
key used to authenticate Dynamic DNS update requests. In this case,
the key specified is not an HMAC\-MD5 key.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP
Local\-host only mode. This sets the server address to localhost
(disabling the \fBserver\fP so that the server address cannot be
overridden). Connections to the local server will use a TSIG key
found in \fB/var/run/named/session.key\fP, which is automatically
generated by \fBnamed\fP if any local master zone has set
\fBupdate\-policy\fP to \fBlocal\fP\&. The location of this key file can be
overridden with the \fB\-k\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP level
Set the logging debug level. If zero, logging is disabled.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP port
Set the port to use for connections to a name server. The default is
53.
.TP
\fB\-P\fP
Print the list of private BIND\-specific resource record types whose
format is understood by \fBnsupdate\fP\&. See also the \fB\-T\fP option.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP udpretries
The number of UDP retries. The default is 3. If zero, only one update
request will be made.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP timeout
The maximum time an update request can take before it is aborted. The
default is 300 seconds. Zero can be used to disable the timeout.
.TP
\fB\-T\fP
Print the list of IANA standard resource record types whose format is
understood by \fBnsupdate\fP\&. \fBnsupdate\fP will exit after the lists
are printed. The \fB\-T\fP option can be combined with the \fB\-P\fP
option.
.sp
Other types can be entered using "TYPEXXXXX" where "XXXXX" is the
decimal value of the type with no leading zeros. The rdata, if
present, will be parsed using the UNKNOWN rdata format, (<backslash>
<hash> <space> <length> <space> <hexstring>).
.TP
\fB\-u\fP udptimeout
The UDP retry interval. The default is 3 seconds. If zero, the
interval will be computed from the timeout interval and number of UDP
retries.
.TP
\fB\-v\fP
Use TCP even for small update requests. By default, \fBnsupdate\fP uses
UDP to send update requests to the name server unless they are too
large to fit in a UDP request in which case TCP will be used. TCP may
be preferable when a batch of update requests is made.
.TP
\fB\-V\fP
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-y\fP [hmac:]keyname:secret
Literal TSIG authentication key. \fBkeyname\fP is the name of the key,
and \fBsecret\fP is the base64 encoded shared secret. \fBhmac\fP is the
name of the key algorithm; valid choices are \fBhmac\-md5\fP,
\fBhmac\-sha1\fP, \fBhmac\-sha224\fP, \fBhmac\-sha256\fP, \fBhmac\-sha384\fP, or
\fBhmac\-sha512\fP\&. If \fBhmac\fP is not specified, the default is
\fBhmac\-md5\fP or if MD5 was disabled \fBhmac\-sha256\fP\&.
.sp
NOTE: Use of the \fB\-y\fP option is discouraged because the shared
secret is supplied as a command line argument in clear text. This may
be visible in the output from ps1 or in a history file maintained by
the user\(aqs shell.
.UNINDENT
.SH INPUT FORMAT
.sp
\fBnsupdate\fP reads input from \fBfilename\fP or standard input. Each
command is supplied on exactly one line of input. Some commands are for
administrative purposes. The others are either update instructions or
prerequisite checks on the contents of the zone. These checks set
conditions that some name or set of resource records (RRset) either
exists or is absent from the zone. These conditions must be met if the
entire update request is to succeed. Updates will be rejected if the
tests for the prerequisite conditions fail.
.sp
Every update request consists of zero or more prerequisites and zero or
more updates. This allows a suitably authenticated update request to
proceed if some specified resource records are present or missing from
the zone. A blank input line (or the \fBsend\fP command) causes the
accumulated commands to be sent as one Dynamic DNS update request to the
name server.
.sp
The command formats and their meaning are as follows:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBserver\fP servername port
Sends all dynamic update requests to the name server \fBservername\fP\&.
When no server statement is provided, \fBnsupdate\fP will send updates
to the master server of the correct zone. The MNAME field of that
zone\(aqs SOA record will identify the master server for that zone.
\fBport\fP is the port number on \fBservername\fP where the dynamic
update requests get sent. If no port number is specified, the default
DNS port number of 53 is used.
.TP
.B \fBlocal\fP address port
Sends all dynamic update requests using the local \fBaddress\fP\&. When
no local statement is provided, \fBnsupdate\fP will send updates using
an address and port chosen by the system. \fBport\fP can additionally
be used to make requests come from a specific port. If no port number
is specified, the system will assign one.
.TP
.B \fBzone\fP zonename
Specifies that all updates are to be made to the zone \fBzonename\fP\&.
If no \fBzone\fP statement is provided, \fBnsupdate\fP will attempt
determine the correct zone to update based on the rest of the input.
.TP
.B \fBclass\fP classname
Specify the default class. If no \fBclass\fP is specified, the default
class is \fBIN\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBttl\fP seconds
Specify the default time to live for records to be added. The value
\fBnone\fP will clear the default ttl.
.TP
.B \fBkey\fP hmac:keyname secret
Specifies that all updates are to be TSIG\-signed using the
\fBkeyname\fP \fBsecret\fP pair. If \fBhmac\fP is specified, then it sets
the signing algorithm in use; the default is \fBhmac\-md5\fP or if MD5
was disabled \fBhmac\-sha256\fP\&. The \fBkey\fP command overrides any key
specified on the command line via \fB\-y\fP or \fB\-k\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBgsstsig\fP
Use GSS\-TSIG to sign the updated. This is equivalent to specifying
\fB\-g\fP on the command line.
.TP
.B \fBoldgsstsig\fP
Use the Windows 2000 version of GSS\-TSIG to sign the updated. This is
equivalent to specifying \fB\-o\fP on the command line.
.TP
.B \fBrealm\fP [realm_name]
When using GSS\-TSIG use \fBrealm_name\fP rather than the default realm
in \fBkrb5.conf\fP\&. If no realm is specified the saved realm is
cleared.
.TP
.B \fBcheck\-names\fP [yes_or_no]
Turn on or off check\-names processing on records to be added.
Check\-names has no effect on prerequisites or records to be deleted.
By default check\-names processing is on. If check\-names processing
fails the record will not be added to the UPDATE message.
.TP
.B \fBprereq nxdomain\fP domain\-name
Requires that no resource record of any type exists with name
\fBdomain\-name\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBprereq yxdomain\fP domain\-name
Requires that \fBdomain\-name\fP exists (has as at least one resource
record, of any type).
.TP
.B \fBprereq nxrrset\fP domain\-name class type
Requires that no resource record exists of the specified \fBtype\fP,
\fBclass\fP and \fBdomain\-name\fP\&. If \fBclass\fP is omitted, IN (internet)
is assumed.
.TP
.B \fBprereq yxrrset\fP domain\-name class type
This requires that a resource record of the specified \fBtype\fP,
\fBclass\fP and \fBdomain\-name\fP must exist. If \fBclass\fP is omitted, IN
(internet) is assumed.
.TP
.B \fBprereq yxrrset\fP domain\-name class type data
The \fBdata\fP from each set of prerequisites of this form sharing a
common \fBtype\fP, \fBclass\fP, and \fBdomain\-name\fP are combined to form
a set of RRs. This set of RRs must exactly match the set of RRs
existing in the zone at the given \fBtype\fP, \fBclass\fP, and
\fBdomain\-name\fP\&. The \fBdata\fP are written in the standard text
representation of the resource record\(aqs RDATA.
.TP
.B \fBupdate delete\fP domain\-name ttl class type data
Deletes any resource records named \fBdomain\-name\fP\&. If \fBtype\fP and
\fBdata\fP is provided, only matching resource records will be removed.
The internet class is assumed if \fBclass\fP is not supplied. The
\fBttl\fP is ignored, and is only allowed for compatibility.
.TP
.B \fBupdate add\fP domain\-name ttl class type data
Adds a new resource record with the specified \fBttl\fP, \fBclass\fP and
\fBdata\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fBshow\fP
Displays the current message, containing all of the prerequisites and
updates specified since the last send.
.TP
.B \fBsend\fP
Sends the current message. This is equivalent to entering a blank
line.
.TP
.B \fBanswer\fP
Displays the answer.
.TP
.B \fBdebug\fP
Turn on debugging.
.TP
.B \fBversion\fP
Print version number.
.TP
.B \fBhelp\fP
Print a list of commands.
.UNINDENT
.sp
Lines beginning with a semicolon are comments and are ignored.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
The examples below show how \fBnsupdate\fP could be used to insert and
delete resource records from the \fBexample.com\fP zone. Notice that the
input in each example contains a trailing blank line so that a group of
commands are sent as one dynamic update request to the master name
server for \fBexample.com\fP\&.

.sp
Any A records for \fBoldhost.example.com\fP are deleted. And an A record
for \fBnewhost.example.com\fP with IP address 172.16.1.1 is added. The
newly\-added record has a 1 day TTL (86400 seconds).

.sp
The prerequisite condition gets the name server to check that there are
no resource records of any type for \fBnickname.example.com\fP\&. If there
are, the update request fails. If this name does not exist, a CNAME for
it is added. This ensures that when the CNAME is added, it cannot
conflict with the long\-standing rule in \fI\%RFC 1034\fP that a name must not
exist as any other record type if it exists as a CNAME. (The rule has
been updated for DNSSEC in \fI\%RFC 2535\fP to allow CNAMEs to have RRSIG,
DNSKEY and NSEC records.)

.SH BUGS
.sp
The TSIG key is redundantly stored in two separate files. This is a
consequence of nsupdate using the DST library for its cryptographic
operations, and may change in future releases.
