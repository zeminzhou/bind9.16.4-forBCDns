.SH SYNOPSIS

\fBrndc\-confgen\fP [\fB\-a\fP] [\fB\-A\fP algorithm] [\fB\-b\fP keysize] [\fB\-c\fP keyfile] [\fB\-h\fP] [\fB\-k\fP keyname] [\fB\-p\fP port] [\fB\-s\fP address] [\fB\-t\fP chrootdir] [\fB\-u\fP user]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBrndc\-confgen\fP generates configuration files for \fBrndc\fP\&. It can be
used as a convenient alternative to writing the \fBrndc.conf\fP file and
the corresponding \fBcontrols\fP and \fBkey\fP statements in \fBnamed.conf\fP
by hand. Alternatively, it can be run with the \fB\-a\fP option to set up a
\fBrndc.key\fP file and avoid the need for a \fBrndc.conf\fP file and a
\fBcontrols\fP statement altogether.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
Do automatic \fBrndc\fP configuration. This creates a file \fBrndc.key\fP
in \fB/etc\fP (or whatever \fBsysconfdir\fP was specified as when BIND
was built) that is read by both \fBrndc\fP and \fBnamed\fP on startup.
The \fBrndc.key\fP file defines a default command channel and
authentication key allowing \fBrndc\fP to communicate with \fBnamed\fP on
the local host with no further configuration.
.sp
Running \fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fP allows BIND 9 and \fBrndc\fP to be used as
drop\-in replacements for BIND 8 and \fBndc\fP, with no changes to the
existing BIND 8 \fBnamed.conf\fP file.
.sp
If a more elaborate configuration than that generated by
\fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fP is required, for example if rndc is to be used
remotely, you should run \fBrndc\-confgen\fP without the \fB\-a\fP option
and set up a \fBrndc.conf\fP and \fBnamed.conf\fP as directed.
.TP
\fB\-A\fP algorithm
Specifies the algorithm to use for the TSIG key. Available choices
are: hmac\-md5, hmac\-sha1, hmac\-sha224, hmac\-sha256, hmac\-sha384 and
hmac\-sha512. The default is hmac\-sha256.
.TP
\fB\-b\fP keysize
Specifies the size of the authentication key in bits. Must be between
1 and 512 bits; the default is the hash size.
.TP
\fB\-c\fP keyfile
Used with the \fB\-a\fP option to specify an alternate location for
\fBrndc.key\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Prints a short summary of the options and arguments to
\fBrndc\-confgen\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-k\fP keyname
Specifies the key name of the rndc authentication key. This must be a
valid domain name. The default is \fBrndc\-key\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP port
Specifies the command channel port where \fBnamed\fP listens for
connections from \fBrndc\fP\&. The default is 953.
.TP
\fB\-s\fP address
Specifies the IP address where \fBnamed\fP listens for command channel
connections from \fBrndc\fP\&. The default is the loopback address
127.0.0.1.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP chrootdir
Used with the \fB\-a\fP option to specify a directory where \fBnamed\fP
will run chrooted. An additional copy of the \fBrndc.key\fP will be
written relative to this directory so that it will be found by the
chrooted \fBnamed\fP\&.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP user
Used with the \fB\-a\fP option to set the owner of the \fBrndc.key\fP file
generated. If \fB\-t\fP is also specified only the file in the chroot
area has its owner changed.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To allow \fBrndc\fP to be used with no manual configuration, run
.sp
\fBrndc\-confgen \-a\fP
.sp
To print a sample \fBrndc.conf\fP file and corresponding \fBcontrols\fP and
\fBkey\fP statements to be manually inserted into \fBnamed.conf\fP, run
.sp
\fBrndc\-confgen\fP
